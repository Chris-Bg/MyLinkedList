Tasks completed:
1. I created my own linked list, that has all 3 parameters of a node (previous, current, next).
2. It contains some methods to modify the linked list, like add(int data), insert(int data), reverse(), sort(), delete(int data), etc; some methods that can access only specific nodes, like get(), min(), max(), etc; some general methods to find the lenght(), to clear() the list and others. 
3. I implemented the iterator for this linked list, called MyIterator, that has the methods hasNext() and remove().
4. I also added MyListGeneric with the method printAll() that prints all the created lists.
5. In the main file there are multiple tests for almost every method.
